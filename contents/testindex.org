* # who i am
I'm a developer with a strong interest in Linux, Ubuntu, and open-source communities. I am passionate about learning and improving, and I'm motivated by the opportunity to work alongside and learn from experienced engineers. I'm eager to take on challenges, contribute where I can, and steadily grow through mentorship, collaboration, and hands-on experience. My goal is not only to develop my technical abilities but also to support the success of the team and the wider open-source community through consistent effort and a willingness to learn.

* # what i am interested in
Beyond coding, I'm passionate about exploring the depths of Linux, contributing to open-source projects, and tinkering with cloud technologies. I'm always looking for new ways to automate, optimize, and build resilient systems. When I'm not at the keyboard, I enjoy hiking and discovering new trails around the city.
