I'm a developer with a strong interest in Linux, Ubuntu, and open-source communities. I am passionate about learning and improving, and I'm motivated by the opportunity to work alongside and learn from experienced engineers. I'm eager to take on challenges, contribute where I can, and steadily grow through mentorship, collaboration, and hands-on experience. My goal is not only to develop my technical abilities but also to support the success of the team and the wider open-source community through consistent effort and a willingness to learn.
