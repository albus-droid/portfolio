#+title: How I Build This Website
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil num:nil html-postamble:nil

I built something like a SSG, there were other options. I could've simply used
something like Hugo or Jekyll, but I thought why not built somthing for myself.
I built this using emacs' html publishing mode. I injected a few css templates to
it and some js and this is how it looks after. Is this a complete SSG, not
really? It maybe a 20% of what a typical SSGs is but it does the 80% of whatever
functionality I think is needed

* What this can do
** This can export my existing org files and export it to html within a nice CSS template
** Export my latex resume to html and display it on the resume page

* I will write about how I implemented this soon
